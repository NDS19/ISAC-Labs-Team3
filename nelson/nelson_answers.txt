    lines for iterative_v0 are going to differ to the original unchanged files
    because of commments i had made; these lines in just iterative_v0 correspond
    to the file i uploaded only

  multiplier_iterative_v0
-line 30 - change i!= 32 to i<= 32
    Note that apparently the program still works with this change
-line 43 - removed 'posedge'
-line 44 - swapped mp_next with mp
-line 48 - changed i_next to i
    Note that apparently the program still works with this change

  pipelined_v4
-line 6 - added a comma at the end of r
-line 16 and 18 - swapped q0 and q2 around
-line 23 - changed clk to clock
  This may not actually change anything but i wanted to experiment
-line 24 - added an extra begin

  reg_file_tb_simple.v
-line 1 - changed 100 to 1OO (with Os not zeroes/0s)
-line 9 - changed bit size to 17
-line 16 - changed dumpvars to dumpvariables
-line 53 - nullified the rising edge by making clk = 0 instead of clk = 1
-lines 78 and 79 - swapped write_index with write_data
